          <h2>Our Story ðŸ“–</h2>
          <p>
            Founded in Noida in 2025, ZYAGRA was born out of a simple
            frustration: why should getting fresh groceries be a chore? Our
            founder, Sandeep Kumar, noticed a gap between the local vendors with
            the freshest produce and the busy households that needed it. With a
            small team and a big dream, we started by making deliveries on our
            own scooters. Today, we've grown into a trusted service for
            thousands of families across Uttar Pradesh, but our commitment to
            quality and community remains the same.
